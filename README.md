# Hypermesh: Meshing The High-Dimensional Spaces for Data Analysis and Visualization

Hypermesh is a header-only C++17 library that meshes high-dimensional spaces for data analysis and visualization, such as feature extraction and tracking (see [https://github.com/hguo/ftk](FTK, the feature tracking kit)), flow map interpolation, and 
topology analysis. 

The library is still under development.  Stay tuned. 

## Basic Components

* High-dimensional mesh and mesh element data structures
* High-dimensional array

## Supported Mesh Types

* Regular grid mesh that consists of hypercubes in arbitrary dimensions
* Tessellated regular grid mesh that consists of simplices in arbitrary dimensions
